# portfolio
 My first portfolio website
 
 The website includes four pages which are home, about, protfolio and contact. It is created using scss for styling, javascript for page transition, button controls etc and media query for responsive page related to the browser size (only Home page seems to be fully responsive right now; need to fix). 
 Currently the submit button on the contact page doesn't function as expected need more fix.
